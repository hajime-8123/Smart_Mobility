## Task 1: Creating a Subscriber Node with Statistics

### 1.1: Download Subscriber Code
Go to the directory ros2_ws/src/cpp_pubsub/src, which was established in a prior tutorial. Download the example subscriber code by executing this command:

```shell
wget -O member_function_with_topic_statistics.cpp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/examples/humble/rclcpp/topics/minimal_subscriber/member_function_with_topic_statistics.cpp
```

Now, you will have a new file, member_function_with_topic_statistics.cpp. Open it with your preferred text editor.

### 1.2: Code Examination
This code produces a subscriber node that receives string messages from a designated "topic" and publishes statistics data regarding these messages. You can fine-tune several options for topic statistics, such as enabling/disabling statistics, specifying the collection window, and defining the publish period.

## Task 2: Modifying CMakeLists.txt

Edit the CMakeLists.txt file and include an executable named listener_with_topic_statistics. This executable allows you to run your node using the command `ros2 run`. This ensures that your pub/sub system, with topic statistics enabled, is ready for use.

## Task 3: Build and Run

To build and run the subscriber node with statistics enabled, follow the guidance presented in the pub/sub tutorial. Specifically, launch the subscriber node with this command:

```shell
ros2 run cpp_pubsub listener_with_topic_statistics
```

Also, start the publisher node using:

```shell
ros2 run cpp_pubsub talker
```

You'll observe messages being published by the publisher and received by the subscriber with statistics enabled.

## Task 4: Observing Published Statistic Data

While the nodes are operational, initiate a new terminal window and execute this command:

```shell
ros2 topic list
```

You will notice the /statistics topic (or the custom topic you may have defined) in the list. This topic holds the statistics data published by the subscriber node.

To view the statistics data, use the following command:

```shell
ros2 topic echo /statistics
```

This will display statistics messages containing metrics such as message age, message period, and other statistics derived from the received messages.

## Summary

By following the steps outlined in this repository, you have created a ROS2 subscriber node with topic statistics enabled. This node publishes statistics data generated by the C++ publisher node, enabling you to monitor and analyze the performance and characteristics of the subscribed topic.
