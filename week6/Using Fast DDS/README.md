ROS Discovery Server Guide (Paraphrased)

# ROS 2 Fast DDS Discovery Server Usage

This guide provides instructions on utilizing the Fast DDS Discovery Server as a discovery protocol for ROS 2.

## Understanding the Fast DDS Discovery Server

The Fast DDS Discovery Server is a centralized discovery mechanism designed to minimize network traffic associated with discovery processes. Unlike some alternatives, it operates without requiring multicasting capabilities.

## Advantages of the Fast DDS Discovery Server

Several compelling reasons exist for opting to employ the Fast DDS Discovery Server:

- Efficient Reduction of Network Traffic Related to Discovery
- No Dependency on Multicasting Capabilities
- User-Friendly
- Reliable Performance

## How to Incorporate the Fast DDS Discovery Server in ROS 2

To implement the Fast DDS Discovery Server with ROS 2, follow these steps:

1. Install the Fast DDS Discovery Server.
2. Configure ROS 2 to use the Fast DDS Discovery Server.
3. Initiate the Fast DDS Discovery Server.
4. Launch your ROS 2 nodes.

## Step-by-Step Guidance

1. Installation of the Fast DDS Discovery Server:

For Ubuntu, use this command:
```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-fastdds-discovery-server
```

For macOS, use this command:
```bash
brew install ros/humble/fastdds-discovery-server
```

2. ROS 2 Configuration for Fast DDS Discovery Server:

Create a file named "ros2_environment.sh" in your .bashrc file. This file will store the essential environment variables that ROS 2 requires to access the Fast DDS Discovery Server.

```bash
# .bashrc
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

# Set the ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER environment variable to the address of the Fast DDS Discovery Server.
export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER=localhost:5555
```

3. Initialization of the Fast DDS Discovery Server:

Execute this command to start the Fast DDS Discovery Server:

```bash
ros2 launch fastdds_discovery_server fastdds_discovery_server.launch.py
```

4. Launch Your ROS 2 Nodes:

Initiate your ROS 2 nodes as needed:

```bash
ros2 launch my_package my_node.launch.py
```

This guide empowers you to seamlessly integrate the Fast DDS Discovery Server into your ROS 2 environment for efficient and reliable discovery processes.
